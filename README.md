The subtitles are
- searched in separate files if they have the name starting as the video file
- you can enter an http link to any subtitle file
- searched inside the video file (ffmpeg is required, please configure the plugin)

If you installed plugin "unsupported-videos", be sure to have version 0.24 or greater.
